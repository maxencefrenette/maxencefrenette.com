I'm a firm believer that the proper tech stack can can help deliver higher
quality applications faster. For my personal projects, I like to take this to
the extreme and use every possible tool that can improve my development
experience.

## Code Quality

### Dependabot

Although there are many alternatives out there, this is the one I first found.
It creates PRs on Github to keep my dependency up to date.

### Prettier


### Eslint


### Typescript



## Hosting

Personally, I'm a fan of [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I get deploy previews on PRs which is especially useful for dependabot PRs. [ZEIT](https://zeit.co/) seems very good too, possibly better because it supports dynamic websites as well.
